# 🚀 Day 1 – Two Sum (LeetCode) | #10Days1Topic10Que

Welcome to Day 1 of my **#10Days1Topic10Que** LeetCode challenge!  
Today’s focus is on one of the most classic array problems: **Two Sum**.

---

## 📌 Problem: [Two Sum – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### 🔹 Description:
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

---

## 🧠 Approaches:

### 1. Brute Force (O(n²))
- Check every pair of elements
- Compare their sum with the target
- Great for understanding the logic behind the problem

### 2. Optimized using HashMap (O(n))
- Store seen numbers with their indices
- For every number, check if the complement exists in the map
- Ideal for coding interviews due to its efficiency
