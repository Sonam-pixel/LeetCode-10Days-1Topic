# ⏳ Day 3 – Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (LeetCode) | #10Days1Topic10Que

Welcome to Day 3 of my **#10Days1Topic10Que** LeetCode challenge!  
Today’s focus is on a fundamental array manipulation task: **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**.

---

## 📌 Problem: [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

### 🔹 Description:
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once.  
Return the number of unique elements and update the original array in-place.

> You must do this in-place with O(1) extra memory.

---

## 🧠 Approaches:

### ✅ Two-Pointer Technique
- Use two pointers: one for iteration, another to track unique elements.
- Whenever a new unique element is found, move it to the correct position.
- Efficient in-place solution with O(n) time and O(1) space.
