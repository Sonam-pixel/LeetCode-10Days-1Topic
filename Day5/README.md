# ⏳ Day 5 – Search Insert Position (LeetCode) | #10Days1Topic10Que

Welcome to Day 5 of my **#10Days1Topic10Que** LeetCode challenge!  
Today’s focus was on **finding the correct index to insert a target in a sorted array**, while keeping time complexity optimal.

## 📌 Problem: [Search Insert Position – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

### 🔹 Description:  
Given a **sorted array of distinct integers** and a `target` value, return the index if the target is found.  
If not, return the index where it would be **inserted in order**.

> The algorithm should run in **O(log n)** time.

---

## 🧠 Approaches:

### ✅ Binary Search (Insert Logic)
- Start with low and high pointers.
- Use mid-point comparison to either move left or right.
- If target not found, return `low` as the correct insert position.

---

## 💻 Code File

- `Search Tnsert Position.java` – Java implementation using binary search to find or determine the correct insertion index in a sorted array.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Binary Search  
- Divide and Conquer  
- Efficient Lookup in Sorted Arrays  
- Index Tracking
