# ⏳ Day 8 – Convert Sorted Array to BST (LeetCode) | #10Days1Topic10Que

Welcome to Day 8 of my **#10Days1Topic10Que** LeetCode challenge!  
Today’s focus was on **converting a sorted array into a height-balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)** — a classic recursion + divide-and-conquer problem.

## 📌 Problem: [Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

### 🔹 Description:  
Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert it into a **height-balanced** binary search tree.

> A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

---

## 🧠 Approaches:

### ✅ Recursive Divide & Conquer (Optimal)
- Pick the **middle element** of the array/subarray to ensure balance.
- Recursively do the same for left and right subarrays to build the BST.
- Each recursive call constructs a subtree with the chosen middle as root.

## 💻 Code File

- `sorted_Array_To_BST.java` – Java implementation using recursive divide-and-conquer method.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Recursion  
- Divide and Conquer  
- Binary Search Tree Properties  
- Height-Balanced Tree Construction  
- Middle Element Strategy
