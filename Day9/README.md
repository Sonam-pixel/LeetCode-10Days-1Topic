# ⏳ Day 9 – Pascal's Triangle (LeetCode) | #10Days1Topic10Que

Welcome to Day 9 of my **#10Days1Topic10Que** LeetCode challenge!  
Today’s focus was on generating **Pascal’s Triangle** — a classic problem involving **2D arrays, loops, and mathematical patterns**.

---

## 📌 Problem: [Pascal's Triangle – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)

### 🔹 Description:  
Given an integer `numRows`, generate the first `numRows` of **Pascal's triangle**.

> In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

---

## 🧠 Approaches:

### ✅ Simple Iterative Construction (Beginner Friendly)
- Start with the first row as `[1]`.
- For each new row, initialize first and last elements as `1`.
- Fill the middle elements by summing the two numbers from the previous row.
- Append each row to the triangle list.
